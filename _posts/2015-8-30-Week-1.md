title: Week 1 Blog Post!
---

Hi guys, this is Naeem Quddus. The most comfortable style of blogging for me is to imagine there's a dialogue going on so that'll be the style I'll attempt to do. 

The purpose of this blog is to record my experiences over the course of this class so that future students have a resource to get an outside perspective on the class. Well, that's the purpose theoretically. In more concrete terms, the purpose of this blog is to get me a little bit of extra credit and hopefully improve my ability to communicate a narrative. 

On to the meat of the post; my first week of Object Oriented Programming taught by Professor Downing. I've been fortunate enough to have learned some software engineering from Professor Downing in the past. Last summer I worked at Bloomberg LP up in New York and he came up to teach some classes on software engineering in Python. He had an interesting style of teaching where he drove the lecture by calling out specific students and having them explain their thoughts on simple examples of whatever subject he wanted to teach. From the first two classes, it seems he's following the same pattern in this course. 

Thus far I haven't developed much of an opinion of this class. The required attendenace (after 5 absences, you lose a letter grade) is an understandable, though draconian, method of ensuring that people actually come to class for Downing's student driven discussion lecture style to work. I haven't done any work yet or experienced a lecture covering more than c++ basics, so I'm not sure about the difficulty of the course.

I expect that I'll have a much more threshed out opinion next week!
